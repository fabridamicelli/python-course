If the version is already installed in our machine uv will just use it, otherwise uv will download it and keep it for future usage.\nuv will create a new directory with all the necessary boilerplate to get python running, including a virtual environment (by default, under the hidden directory .venv) and a pyproject.toml file (we’ll look at those later when dealing with dependencies).\nFor more details on uv and projects see the documentation here.\nChange your directory into the newly created folder:\ncd pycourse\nYou should see a structure like this:\npycourse\n├── pyproject.toml\n├── README.md\n└── src\n    └── pycourse\n        └── __init__.py",

We can also represent non-integer numbers as floats:\n\n1.2 + 1.3\n\n2.5\n\n\n\ntype(1.2 + 2.3)\n\nfloat\n\n\nAlso notice:\n\ntype(1)\n\nint\n\n\n\ntype(1.0)\n\nfloat\n\n\n\ntype(1.)\n\nfloat\n\n\nAlso, these three numbers evaluate to equal, as we can check using the equality operator:\n\n1 == 1. == 1.0\n\nTrue\n\n\nIf we add an int to a float, we get:\n\ntype(1 + 1.)\n\nfloat\n\n\nFloating point numbers are an approximation:\n\n0.1 + 0.2\n\n0.30000000000000004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor now: A floating point is just a way that computers have to approximately represent numbers. For the most part, we will not have to think too much about them starting our Python journey.\nIn case you want to learn more about floating point numbers you can watch this great video: \n\n\nPython also has strings:\n\ntype(\"Hi there\")\n\nstr\n\n\n\n\"Hi there\" == 'Hi there'  # Notice both \" and ' can be used\n\nTrue\n\n\nStrings are very powerful and have many “methods” associated with them that facilitates manipulating them. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn this context, a “method” is just a function attached to another entity, for example a string. We’ll learn more about them later on.\n\n\n\n\"HELLO World\".lower()\n\n'hello world'\n\n\n\n\"HELLO World\".startswith(\"he\")\n\nFalse\n\n\n\n\"HELLO World\".lower().startswith(\"he\")\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\"HELLO World\".endswith(\"d\")\n\nTrue\n\n\nThere are more methods defined on strings.\nWhenever you’re trying to do some operation over a string consider checking first if the method is already there. If you are in an interactive environment like the REPL or a jupyter notebook, you can type “.” (dot) and hit TAB for suggestions, for example:\n\nWe can format strings using a handy language construct: f-strings, which allow us to easily manipulate strings in a dynamical fashion, even executing code inside them. For example:\n\nf\"Hello world, I think {1 + 1} = 2\"\n\n'Hello world, I think 2 = 2'\n\n\n\nf\"The {'INNER SHOUTING STRING'.lower()} should be lower\"\n\n'The inner shouting string should be lower'\n\n\nNotice that we alternated ” and ’.\nWe’ll see more examples of f-strings later on, as they are a super handy tool adding a lot of expresivity to the language.",

    "text": "3.4 Lists\nWe can store elements in different kinds of containers, collections of elements.\nlist is the most common of them. We can store basically anything in them, including repetitions of the same element:\n\nshort = [\"having fun\", 123]\ntype(short)\n\nlist\n\n\n\nmixed = [\"hello\", 1, 2., short, short]\nmixed\n\n['hello', 1, 2.0, ['having fun', 123], ['having fun', 123]]\n\n\nWe can access the elements of the list via their indices (starting at 0)\n\nmixed[0], mixed[-1]  # Notice -1: refers to the last element\n\n('hello', ['having fun', 123])\n\n\nWe can take parts of that list, a so-called slice, by indicating a slice of indexes. The slice has the syntax (start, stop, [step]), the step is optional and can be negative. The slice is inclusive on the left and exclusive on the right:\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nnumbers[1: -1]  # Start from second until last (not including it)\n\n[2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n\nImportantly, we can modify a list:\n\nmixed\n\n['hello', 1, 2.0, ['having fun', 123], ['having fun', 123]]\n\n\n\nmixed[0] = 100\nmixed\n\n[100, 1, 2.0, ['having fun', 123], ['having fun', 123]]\n\n\nYou should think of lists as a sequence of references to other elements (objects). Here’s a practical example:\n\nshort = [\"python\", 1, 2]\nlong = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, short, short]\n\n\nshort[1] = \"is\"\nshort[2] = \"fun\"\n\n\nshort\n\n['python', 'is', 'fun']\n\n\n\nlong\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ['python', 'is', 'fun'], ['python', 'is', 'fun']]\n\n\nSince long is simply holding a reference to short, if we modify short, we’ll see that change propagate to long.\nWe can add elements to a list using the .append method:\n\nresult = [1, 2]\nresult.append(\"hello again\")\nresult\n\n[1, 2, 'hello again']\n\n\nRemoving elements is also possible:\n\nresult.remove?\n\n\nSignature: result.remove(value, /)\nDocstring:\nRemove first occurrence of value.\nRaises ValueError if the value is not present.\nType:      builtin_function_or_method\n\n\n\n\nresult.remove(1)\n\n\nresult\n\n[2, 'hello again']\n\n\n\nresult.remove(1)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[37], line 1\n----&gt; 1 result.remove(1)\n\nValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMutability\nIn Python some types can be modified in-place (thus we say there are mutable), for example list. Others can’t be modified after creating them, thus immutable, for example tuple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nExplore the buil-int methods associated to list, there are handy ones, like .sort\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNames and Variables can be a bit tricky in Python.

That means we can build them from those paired items:\n\nitems = [\n    (\"one\", 1),\n    (\"two\", 2),\n    (\"three\", 3),\n]\nitems\n\n[('one', 1), ('two', 2), ('three', 3)]\n\n\n\npairs = dict(items)\npairs, type(pairs)\n\n({'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}, dict)\n\n\nWe often want to iterate through the elements of a dictionary.\nBy default iterating over a dictionary goes over the keys:\n\nfor key in pairs:\n    print(key)\n\none\ntwo\nthree\n\n\n\nfor key in pairs.keys():\n    print(key)\n\none\ntwo\nthree\n\n\n\nfor val in pairs.values():\n    print(val)\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n\nfor item in pairs.items():\n    print(item)\n\n('one', 1)\n('two', 2)\n('three', 3)\n\n\n\nkeys = pairs.keys()\nkeys\n\ndict_keys(['one', 'two', 'three'])\n\n\n\nvals = pairs.values()\nvals\n\ndict_values([1, 2, 3])\n\n\nWe can combine two collections, for example two lists, with the zip function. zip interleaves elements and stops as soon as the shortest collection is consumed:\n\ndict(zip(keys, vals))\n\n{'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}\n\n\nThe inverse operation to zip can be done by unpacking (with *) the arguments like this:\n\nlist(zip(*zip(keys, vals)))\n\n[('one', 'two', 'three'), (1, 2, 3)]\n\n\nIn Python we can “unpack” sequences directly during assignment:\n\nseq = [1,2]\n\n\nfirst, second = seq\n\n\nfirst, second\n\n(1, 2)\n\n\n\nseq = (1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n\nfirst, *rest = seq\nfirst, rest\n\n(1, [2, 3, 4])\n\n\n\nfirst, *middle, last = seq\nfirst, middle, last\n\n(1, [2, 3], 4)\n\n\nWe can iterate and unpack the items of a dictionary on the fly:\n\nfor key, val in pairs.items():\n    print(f\"{key} -&gt; {val}\")\n\none -&gt; 1\ntwo -&gt; 2\nthree -&gt; 3\n\n\nWe can modify a dictionary, by updating an item or items:\n\npairs\n\n{'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}\n\n\n\npairs.update({\"one\": 111})\npairs\n\n{'one': 111, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}\n\n\n\npairs[\"four\"] = 4\npairs\n\n{'one': 111, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4}\n\n\nDictionary keys must be immutable. That’s a perfect use case for tuples too:\n\nmutable_key = [1,2,3]\nimmutable_key = (1,2,3)\n\n\n{mutable_key: \"not gonna work\"}  # Try to build a dictionary\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[8], line 1\n----&gt; 1 {mutable_key: \"not gonna work\"}  # Try to build a dictionary\n\nTypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n\n\n\n\nd = {immutable_key: \"that looks better\"}\n\nAnd we can retrieve that value as per usual:\n\nd[(1,2,3)]\n\n'that looks better'\n\n\n\nd[1,2,3]  # optionally without parenthesis\n\n'that looks better'\n\n\nAll these built-in types that we’ve seen so far can take you already pretty far in manipulating data, both for quick exploration and for more detailed analysis. So it will really pay off to have a good grasp on them, take your time to learn them!\nHere’s a talk for you to watch later that hammers home this point with great mastery:",

    "text": "6.7 Exercises\n\nWrite a function called intro that takes two positional arguments, name and age, and prints a sentence introducing a person. The function should return nothing.\nRepeat it, but adding an optional argument, city. The function should now return the introducing string and handle the city input too.\nWrite a function called sort_dict_by_value that takes a dictionary and returns a dictionary sorted by value.\nWrite a function that takes an arbitrary number of key-word only arguments representing pairs (name, age) and returns a list of tuples sorted by age. For example:\n\n# For this pairs\nyour_function(lua=32, mark=12)\n# Should output:\n[(\"mark\", 12), (\"lua\", 32)]\nThe very same function should be able to deal with other number of arguments, eg:\nyour_function(lua=32, mark=12, anna=42)\n# Should output:\n[(\"mark\", 12), (\"lua\", 32), (\"anna\", 42)]\nHint: Try to use the function sort_dict that you wrote in the previous point.\n\nWrite a function that takes 2 arguments items (a container of elements,no matter what they are) and sorting_func (a function that will somehow sort the elements of items) and returns the result of the sorting function applied to items. For example, your function should behave like this:\n\nyour_function([3, 2, 1], sorted)\n# Should output:\n[1, 2, 3]\n\nyour_function({\"a\": 2, \"b\": 1}, sort_dict)\n# Should output:\n{\"b\": 1, \"a\": 2}",

    "text": "10.1 Managing dependencies\nIn contrast to the code that we ourselves write and can import or to some built-in modules such as pathlib and json that we can import directly after installing python, there are third-party libraries that we want to use but need to be first installed, such as numpy and pandas.\nThis libraries are also called “packages”. There are several repositories where people publish python packages and from which we can download them, but the official one is PyPI (Python Package Index).\nThese are open-source libraries maintained mostly by voluntary contributions of people of the community – and you can also contribute to them!\nThey are being actively developed and thus in permanent evolution. In order to avoid compatibility problems and to ensure reproducibility, we might want to specify the exact versions of the packages we use. It turns out that is not an easy problem and the reason why need a package manager.\nThe good news is that uv does that for us too.\nThe standard to specify dependencies (and other things) in python projects is to use a file called pyproject.toml that looks like this:\nThe “dependencies” section is the one we care about here. There we list all the third-party libraries that our project requires. Notice that we can specify both exact versions (with “==”) as well as constraints (with “&lt;,&gt;,&gt;=,&lt;=”).\nIn general we don’t want to deal manually with those aspects – that’s the job of a package manager.\nWe will use here the package manager uv. You can read the docs for more details, which I strongly recommend since the documentation is pretty good and constantly being updated. To add a dependency we type:\nFor example:\nThat will add the dependency to our list as well as updating the “lock” file. Read more about this workflow and managing dependencies here.\nTo remove a package from the dependencies of our project we do:\nFor example:",

An object is an instance, that is a particular realization, of a class.\nHere’s an analogy: You can think of a class as the instructions to build a car, say a FiatUno:\nclass FiatUno:\n    def __init__(self, color=\"white\", radio=False):\n        self.color = color\n        self.radio = radio\n        self.radio_is_on = False\n    def turn_on_radio(self):\n        self.radio_is_on = True\n        print(f\"Radio is on!\")\n    def turn_off_radio(self):\n        self.radio_is_on = False\n        print(f\"Radio is off!\")\nEach actual car is an object, i.e. an instance of a class:\ncar1 = FiatUno()\nWe can make another car:\ncar2 = FiatUno()\nLike two cars can be the same model and color, they always have different license plates.\nThe same happens in python:\nid(car1)\n\n139856081602784\nid(car2)\n\n139856081603648\nEach object has attributes:\ncar1.color, car1.radio\n\n('white', False)",

For example, the __str__ method defines the string representation of the object, which is used when we call print on an object. When we do print(something), python actually goes to the method __str__ of something and calls that one. Let’s see it in action:\n\nclass A:\n    def __init__(self, msg=\"hello\"):\n        self.msg = msg\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.msg + \", nice to meet you\"\n\n\na = A()\n\n\nprint(a)\n\nhello, nice to meet you\n\n\nIt’s good to know that these dunder methods exist and some libraries will require the user changing them.

    "text": "16.1.1 Anatomy of a Figure\nThe most common plotting library in python is matplotlib. matplotlib is very comprehensive and brings many idiomatic choices that sometimes can make it a bit cumbersome to wrap our heads around, so don’t worry if you struggle with it a bit at first.\nWe will look at the most basic forms of plotting to try to understand the basic building blocks. To go beyond that you will for sure need to look up more things, but the good news is that matplotlib is a decently old and very mature project, which facilitates searching for information on the internet and its official documentation is pretty good too. To discover functionalities and for searching information, it is useful to take a look at the components of a plot:\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the code behind this figure in the matplotlib documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTake a look at the examples gallery to reach for inspiration and guidance to plot your data.\nAlso, even free Large Language Models (LLMs) such as (bing.com’s or brave’s built-in copilots) are pretty good at generating plotting instructions, especially when given the precise terminology regarding the plot – give them a try if you feel stuck making a figure.\n\n\n\n\n16.1.2 Install matplotlib\nuv add matplotlib\n\n\n16.1.3 Basic Plotting\nThe official documentation has a nice quick intro to matplotlib concepts, let’s take a look at that here.\nYou can find some nice cheatsheets here.\nOne quick way to plot is calling functions from the pyplot module.\nThese are some of the most of the commonly used functions:\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n\nx = np.linspace(0, 10)\ny = x * 2 + 1\nz = x * 3 + 1\n\n\nplt.plot(x, y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplt.scatter(x, z)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplt.hist(x, bins=15);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is fine and can take us far, especially for rapid exploration. But it has some limitations. There is a more powerful and extensive API way to plot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAPI means Application Programming Interface. More details in the glossary.\n\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()  # Create a figure containing a single Axes\nax.plot(x, y)             # Plot on that Axes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplt.polar(x, y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(8, 3.5))  # Create a figure containing 2 Axes\nax1.plot(x, y)\nax2.scatter(x, y)\nfig.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that fig also contains the axes and that axes are a numpy array!\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2);\nfig.delaxes(axes[0])\nfig.delaxes(axes[1])\ntype(axes)\n\nnumpy.ndarray\n\n\n&lt;Figure size 640x480 with 0 Axes&gt;\n\n\nThis numpy array grid generalizes and indeed how this objects compose nicely with the python language in general:\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2, nrows=2)\n((ax1, ax2), (ax3, ax4)) = axes\nax1.plot(x, y, color=\"red\")\nax2.scatter(x, y, color=\"red\", marker=\".\")\nax3.plot(x, y)\nax4.scatter(x, y, marker=\".\")\n\nfor i, ax in enumerate(axes.flatten(), start=1):\n    ax.set_title(f\"This is plot number {i}\")\n    ax.set_xlabel(\"x-variable\")\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"y-variable\")\nfig.suptitle(\"What a Figure!\")  # Yeah, set_suptitle would be nicer\nfig.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata = np.outer(x, x)\n\ndef plot_images(data):\n    fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(8, 5))\n    img1 = ax1.imshow(data)\n    img2 = ax2.imshow(data, origin=\"lower\", cmap=\"Oranges\")\n    ax2.set_xticks([])\n    ax2.set_yticks([])\n    plt.colorbar(img1, shrink=.5)\n    plt.colorbar(img2, shrink=.5)\n    fig.tight_layout()\n\nplot_images(data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.1.4 Saving Figures\nWe can save the figure in different formats (the file extensions serves as guide):\n\nfig.savefig(\"fig.png\")\nfig.savefig(\"fig.svg\")  # Vector graphics are supported out of the box!\n\nIf you want a more in-depth introduction to the matplotlib library, take a look at this talk.",

By incorrect we do not mean proper business logic nor being statistically sound. We mean something much simpler: The code does what we think it is doing.\nOne way to build some confidence about the correctness of code is to write tests. We are going to deal here with so-called unit tests. As the name suggests, these tests target pieces, blocks (units) of code that we can test isolated. For example, here’s a simple function that computes the square of a number and a little test:\ndef square(value):\n    return value * value\n\ndef test_square():\n    assert square(-1) == 1\n    assert square(1) == 1\n    assert square(2) == 4\n    assert square(5) == 25\n\ntest_square()\nRefactoring: Having tests in place can be also useful when we want to modify working code, since they will give us at least some degree of confidence that we are not breaking the functionality when we refactor the code, for example, while optimizing running time.\nAs we saw above we can write the assertions about our code in a function that we then call. Calling each test manually is a bit cumbersome and error prone. We will use instead a testing framework that will do this automatically for us (plus, it’s going to provide us with a whole bunch of handy functionalities out of the box).",

Further examples of aspects to be tested include: Verifying responses from an API, check that a machine learning model can deal with a given input, etc. Testing software is in itself a whole field, there are even dedicated testing conferences!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTake a look at the test suite of popular open source libraries to learn how testing looks like in the “real world”.",

Testing dependencies are usually included under “development” dependencies. That means, dependencies that will be used during development but not later on (for example when running the application code in production).\nWe can also do that with our package manager uv passing the --dev flag:\nuv add --dev pytest\nAfter executing that line, you can verify that the dependency where the dependency is listed by looking into the pyproject.toml file, which should look like this:\n[tool.uv]\ndev-dependencies = [\n    \"pytest&gt;=8.3.3\",\n]\n\n17.3.1 Basic Testing\nIn the python ecosystem it is rather common to have a separated directory for tests, but that is just an implicit convention and no hard requirement at all. But to keep things tidy we’ll follow that.\nFirst we will put the source code that has our functionality in a file under src/pycourse/square.py\ndef square(value):\n    return value * value\nSo let’s create a directory (next to src) called tests and make a file called tests/test_square.py including our previous test_square code:\nfrom pycourse.square import square  # Import function from source code test\n\ndef test_square():\n    assert square(-1) == 1\n    assert square(1) == 1\n    assert square(2) == 4\n    assert square(5) == 25\nNotice that we do not call the function, we just define it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe file must be called test_*.py or *_test.py for pytest to discover it and the unit tests must start with test_.\n\n\nWe can now run our tests (pytest will discover files and tests following the pattern above mentioned):\nuv run pytest tests\nYou should see something like this:\ntests/test_square.py .                          [100%]\n\n================== 1 passed in 0.01s =================\nThat’s our first test, we’re cruising! :D\n\n\n17.3.2 Make sure something fails\nSometimes we want to make sure our program fails given a certain input. For example, let’s say we want to check the input of our square function is a float or integer. We could add that logic to the function and handle the case:\n\ndef square(value):\n    if not isinstance(value, (float, int)):\n        raise ValueError(f\"Invalid input. Expected float, got {type(value)}\")\n    return value * value\n\n\n\nCode\nimport ipytest\nipytest.autoconfig()\n\n\n\n%%ipytest\n\nimport pytest\n\ndef test_square():\n    assert square(-1) == 1\n    assert square(1) == 1\n    assert square(2) == 4\n    assert square(5) == 25  \n    with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n        square(\"foo\")\n    with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n        square(None)\n\n\n.                                                                                            [100%]\n\n1 passed in 0.01s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nChecking the types of the functions explicitly like in the example is not a very “pythonic” thing to do, as we tend to care more about the behaviour than about the types (duck typing). Also it is a relatively inefficient way to do it. But sometimes we do trade some purity and efficiency for correctness, for example in data pipelines where errors can go unattended because they do not lead to syntax errors.",
