# About the Course {.unnumbered}
This is an open, free **short introduction** to the Python programming language, emphasizing practical over theoretical aspects and with a focus on data-related tasks.  
The goal is to get you just enough tools under your belt to enable you on pursuing your own learning path according to your interests. 
What's in for you:


âœ… Core concepts of the language explained with _simple words_  
âœ… Focused intro to data-tools ([numpy](https://numpy.org), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/))  
âœ… Software engineering best-practices (project and dependency management with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), testing with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/), error handling, etc.)  
âœ… Exercises accompanying the chapters  
âœ… Integrative "Labs" with real-world datasets to put all concepts together  
âœ… References to open and free material to deepen your knowledge (talks, book chapters, cheatsheets, etc.)
