# About the Course {.unnumbered}
This is a free, **short introduction** to the Python programming language, emphasizing practical over theoretical aspects and with a focus on data-related tasks.  
The goal is to get you just enough tools under your belt for you to pursue your own learning path according to your interests. 
What's in for you:


✅ Core concepts of the language explained in _simple words_  
✅ Focus on "data-stack" ([numpy](https://numpy.org), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), etc.)  
✅ Software engineering best-practices (project/dependency management, [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), testing with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/), error handling, etc.)  
✅ Exercises on each chapter to get comfortable with the new concepts   
✅ Integrative "Labs" with real-world datasets to put all concepts together  
✅ Useful references to deepen your knowledge (talks, books, cheatsheets, etc.)
