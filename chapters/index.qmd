# About the Course {.unnumbered}
This is a short introduction to the Python programming language.   
We will emphasize practical over theoretical aspects with a focus on data-related tasks, a great target for the Python language!

After the course, you will have practical tools under your belt to tackle daily data-related and common automation tasks with Python as well as enough knowledge to bootstrap yourself in your own learning path.

You can check out the code notebooks and report any problems on [this GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/fabridamicelli/python-course).

Off we go! ðŸš€
